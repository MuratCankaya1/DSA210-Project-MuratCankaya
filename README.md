📊 DSA 210 Term Project
Understanding How Lifestyle & Fitness Metrics Influence Study Motivation

🧩 1. Project Overview
This project aims to examine how various health and lifestyle factors — including daily physical activity, calorie expenditure, heart rate patterns, sleep quality, and gym activity — influence a student’s daily study motivation.
Modern wearable devices (Apple Watch, Fitbit, Garmin, etc.) continuously track key physiological and behavioral metrics that reflect a person's overall well-being. Since physical health, sleep quality, and exercise habits are strongly connected to mood, cognitive performance, and motivation, this project investigates whether these measurable signals can help explain or predict daily fluctuations in study motivation.
The goal is to explore whether healthier daily routines and better physical metrics correspond to higher academic motivation levels.

🗂️ 2. Data Overview & Collection Methods
This project uses a multi-source dataset representing different dimensions of lifestyle health and activity.
The dataset includes daily self-logged values combined with wearable-device style metrics that can either be collected manually or simulated for analysis.

| **Dataset**                  | **Description**                                                                                          | **Collection Method**                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Daily Activity Data**      | Total steps, active minutes, movement intensity. Reflects overall physical movement.                     | Manually recorded or obtained from a wearable device (Apple Health / Google Fit exports). |
| **Calorie Expenditure Data** | Total calories burned per day (active + basal). Represents daily physical load.                          | Wearable device export or manually logged estimates.                                      |
| **Heart Rate Data**          | Resting HR, average HR, and peak HR during the day. Indicates stress, fitness level, and physical state. | Apple Watch, Fitbit, or manual approximation.                                             |
| **Sleep Quality Data**       | Total sleep time, deep sleep minutes, sleep efficiency, sleep satisfaction score.                        | Wearable device sleep data or self-reported values.                                       |
| **Gym Activity Data**        | Whether the gym was attended that day, workout duration, intensity rating (1–10).                        | Self-logged data.                                                                         |
| **Study Motivation**         | Daily study motivation score (1–10 scale), self-reported each day.                                       | Logged through daily self-tracking.                                                       |

🎯 3. Research Question
To what extent do daily activity level, calorie expenditure, heart rate, sleep quality, and gym activity impact and explain daily study motivation?
This question aims to identify which physiological and lifestyle factors are the most influential predictors of motivation to study.

📐 4. Hypotheses
Null Hypothesis (H₀):
Daily activity, calorie expenditure, heart rate, sleep quality, and gym activity have no significant effect on daily study motivation.
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):
Daily activity, calorie expenditure, heart rate, sleep quality, and gym activity have a significant effect on daily study motivation.
(Multiple regression and correlation analysis will be used to test these.)

💪 5. Motivation
There are several reasons behind choosing this topic:
I actively track my fitness and daily health metrics, making this project directly relevant to my personal life.
Study motivation fluctuates a lot, and I want to understand whether physical health metrics explain these fluctuations.
Modern students often struggle with balancing gym, daily activity, sleep, and study routines — this project can reveal practical insights.
Health, sleep, and exercise have strong theoretical links with discipline, mood, and cognitive ability.
I aim to analyze whether better lifestyle habits genuinely improve my study motivation or whether the relationship is more complex.
By analyzing these metrics together, I hope to identify which daily habits contribute most to staying motivated academically.
