    "## Understanding How Lifestyle & Fitness Metrics Influence Study Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Introduction\n",
    "This notebook presents an exploratory analysis of how daily lifestyle metrics — including steps, calorie expenditure, resting and average heart rate, sleep, and gym activity — influence daily study motivation levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern wearable devices (Apple Watch, Fitbit, Garmin, etc.) offer continuous tracking of health indicators. These metrics often correlate with cognitive performance, focus, and discipline. In this project, I investigate whether daily study motivation can be partially explained using these measurable behavioral signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals of This Notebook\n",
    "- Load and explore the dataset\n",
    "- Clean and prepare the data (if needed)\n",
    "- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations\n",
    "- Examine correlations between lifestyle metrics and study motivation\n",
    "- Build simple regression models to test the hypothesis\n",
