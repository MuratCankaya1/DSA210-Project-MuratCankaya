# DSA210 Term Project  
## Understanding How Lifestyle & Fitness Metrics Influence Study Motivation

### Introduction
This notebook explores how daily lifestyle metrics — including steps, calorie expenditure, resting heart rate, average heart rate, sleep duration, sleep quality, and gym activity — relate to daily study motivation levels.

Wearable devices (Apple Watch, Fitbit, Garmin, etc.) continuously collect health indicators that can reflect stress, energy levels, discipline, and cognitive performance. This notebook investigates whether these measurable lifestyle signals can help explain or predict fluctuations in study motivation.

### Goals of This Notebook
- Load and explore the dataset  
- Perform data cleaning if necessary  
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Examine relationships between lifestyle metrics and study motivation  
- Build regression models to test the hypothesis
